Discharge Summary:

We are treating an emergency cardiologist who lives in a hospital with multiple patient discharge reports of chest pain and/or heart failure. Although some patients have been discharged for other reasons, all have been treated for chest pain. The most common complaints we see are chest pain, and we do not know if there has been any type of discharge.


The discharge report should be a description of the patient's medical history, such as if the patient is diabetic, hypertension, or any other health condition. We also want to know whether there is any history of recent stroke.

A discharge summary can be sent to the cardiologist's office to see if the patient is currently receiving medications or whether an appointment or a patient-centered approach is possible.

We recommend following these steps:

Provide the patient with an accurate discharge report.

Check for any other health conditions, such as:

Cancer

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Fever

Intestinal bleeding or bleeding during surgery

Fibromyalgia

Gastrointestinal bleeding or swelling

Oral ulcers

Sneezing

Trap bleeding

Sudden or unexplained vomiting
